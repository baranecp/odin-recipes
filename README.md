# odin-recipes
This is my first project from The Odin Project.
While working on it, I learned how to write a basic HTML boilerplate, what elements and tags are, how to work with text, how to create links, and the difference between absolute and relative links. I also learned how to display images on a webpage, along with other foundational HTML skills.
